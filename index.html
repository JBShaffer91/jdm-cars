<p>This custom widebody, designed by Khyzyl Saleem, is a true work of art.  Utilizing the LTO X KC FD3S RX-7 Kit (why they couldn't give it a fancy name is beyond us). This FD3S RX-7 will behave similarly to the Honda S2000, the jack-of-all-trades of tuner cars.</p>

<h2>1996 Nissan 180SX Type X (S13)</h2>

<p>Built by body shop mechanic Masaru Ishikawa for his wife, Hitomi, is a fantastic example of a practical daily driver/weekend drift car. Powered by a 1 JZ MkII engine sitting in a tubbed engine bay and completed by an extreme widebody makeover, this is make gorgeous drift missle.</p>

<h2>2002 Honda S2000</h2>

<p>We really did save the best for last. The Honda S2000 is one of the most renowned sports cars of the late 90's and early 2000's. Featured in <a href="https://fastandfurious.fandom.com/wiki/2000_Honda_S2000">Fast and the Furious</a> and envied by JDM enthusiests everywhere, it's the perfect car to invest your time and money into. We say "invest" because if this is your dream car it'll cost you quite a bit of both.</a></p>
